## Me

I'm Hern√°n Chilabert, Full-Stack web developer and basketball player. I worked at Electronic Goverment of Buenos Aires City as a project leader of [BA ID](https://id.buenosaires.gob.ar/) (Digital Citizen Identity) and [Mi BA](http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/miba) (Citizen Dashboard).

I'm a restless and curious person. Everthing I know I learned on my own. In my spare time I play basketball, learn and research about new technologies and read some books.
