We build a [Digital ID Provider](https://id.buenosaires.gob.ar/) for the Buenos Aires City to create a new digital experience for our users by simplifying processes and avoiding requesting information that they have already uploaded.

We chose [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) over other technologies because we wanted to use an open standard for our ID Service.

> Today, we decide to share the source code as Open BA ID platform to the world.

Open BA ID is available to any government that wants to have its own digital identity.
